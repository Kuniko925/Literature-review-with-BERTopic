## Project Description
Fairness in AI is getting a significant presence in AI ethics. Fairness is positioned third in a prevailing ethical issue ranking [1], and the EU allocated it as one of the seven criteria for trustworthiness in their guideline. Meanwhile, the word "Fairness" is broadly used in numerous cross-discipline fields, not only in the AI field. Consequently, it makes searching the target literature complex to investigate fairness even with concurrence words such as AI, machine learning, and deep learning. We employed topic modelling, BERTopic which assembles embedding, reducing dimentionality, clustering and class-based TF-IDF and automated a part of the literature review process [2].
